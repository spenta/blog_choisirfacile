HOW TO CHANGE THE LOGO
======================
In themes folder, look up for the LOGO folder. Inside is a logo.zip archive, unpack it with winrar. Open logo.psd in photoshop and rename it, turn off background layer, then - File/Save for web, choose png24 format (transparency must be checked), and save/replace it (replace it) with logo in themename/images folder. Voila!
Install font (if provided) from logo.rar to your computer if you dont have it. 


THEME OPTIONS
============
To have an images in the slider, you just add a custom field, type slide (lowercase) and leave link to the image. Or check howtoslide.png in themefolder/images/, visual is better :)
But, first of first, you should select sliding category via theme options (number of slides is set to 4 by default). 
Hint: Enable custom fields in "Screen Options" at the top right corner!


FLICKR SETTINGS
===============
With some themes comes flickr widget, and only thing you need to do, is to paste some code that you'll get from your flickr account.

Example:
<script type="text/javascript"  src="http://www.flickr.com/badge_code_v2.gne?count=9&display=latest&size=t&layout=x&source=user&user=18867172%40N00"></script>

Please read this link to see how to get this code:
http://www.pearsonified.com/2006/03/how_to_add_a_styled_flickr_pho.php

You just need to paste js code thats inside this div - <div class="flickr_badge"></div>, no need to copy all what you get in the widget.
Size of image is determined by theme.


POST THUMBNAILS - how to add images into posts
==============================================
This theme supports post thumbnails, and we encourage you to use this option for theme to work as imagined! 

How to insert image as a post thumbnail? 

For example, click on add new post. 
On the bottom right side under "Post tags" you'll see a "Set featured image" option, and click on it.
Upload the image, click "Use as featured image" and thats it!
You dont have to touch anything other (alignment, sizes, nothing), theme will do the rest!


You also can adjust image size according to your wishes. Just open up index.php, find 'image_class' => 'alignleft', 'width' => '200', 'height' => '150'")
and change 200, 150 (this values may be different for every our theme) to whatever you like. If you want images to be aligned right or centered, just change alignleft to alignright or aligncenter and save. 

Classic way of inserting images is still working with this theme, but featured categories (latest articles on categories) option - IS NOT if theme has it! It's set to pull post thumbnails images where images are inserted as thumbnails, classic inserted images will not show, insted - default image will show (can be found in theme-folder/images/fcdefault.jpg).


WHAT NOT TO DO?
===============
Do not install wp pagenavi plugin, since its built into theme. It will just mess your site. Use the one in the theme, its the same one. Thanks!

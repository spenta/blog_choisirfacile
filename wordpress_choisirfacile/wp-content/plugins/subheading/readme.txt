Adds the ability to easily add and display a sub title/heading on both posts and pages.

== Description ==

This plugin uses a custom field to allow sub titles/headings to be added to both posts and pages.

The custom subheading field is re-positioned so it is directly below the main title when editing.

By default subheadings are also appended to RSS feeds and the admin edit post/page lists.

== Installation ==

Here we go:

1. Upload the `subheading` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place `<?php if (function_exists('the_subheading')) { the_subheading('<p>', '</p>'); } ?>` in your template files where you want it to appear, or enable the `Automatically append before the content` option on the settings page.
4. Add the subheading content using the standard WordPress edit page.

The settings for this plugin are found by navigating to the `Plugins` menu and selecting `SubHeading`.

If you are not within `the_loop`, you can use `get_the_subheading($postID);` to fetch the value for a particular page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I enable subheadings on posts? =

By default subheadings are disabled for posts, you can enable them on the settings page `Plugins > SubHeading > Enable for posts as well as pages`.

= What custom field name does it use? =

The field name used is `_subheading`, the underscore prefix prevents it from being displayed in the list of custom fields.

= How can I append the subheading to my RSS feed? =

Check the RSS option on the settings page `Plugins > SubHeading > Append to RSS feeds`.

= What if I want to include shortcodes in my subheading? =

Check the apply shortcode filters option on the settings page `Plugins > SubHeading > Apply shortcode filters`.

This will apply any existing shortcode filters to the subheading value you have set.

= How can I prevent the subheading input moving to the top of the edit page? =

Some plugins will hide the element containing the post title, which is this element that the subheading input is appended to.

You can prevent the repositioning of the input via the options page.

= What are the `Before` and `After` inputs used for? =

If you are using the `Automatically append before the content` option, you can include custom content before and after the subheading is displayed.

For example, setting Before to `<h3>` and after to `</h3>` will wrap the subheading in a h3 tag.

== Screenshots ==

1. The SubHeading option is displayed directly below the main title.
2. Settings are managed using a plugin options page.
